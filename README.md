## Work Day Scheduler

# Purpose
As an employee with a busy schedule you want to add important events to a daily planner.
This will make you manage your time effectively.

# Build With
* Javascript
* HTML
* CSS

# How it works
* When you open your planner, you can see the current date and time.
* When you click into a time card, you can enter a time event.
* When you set an event you can save it, remove it, or make edits.
* When a task is saved, the browser can be refreshed and keep the saved task.
* When a task is within it's current time slot and all time slots in the future, the border of the card     will be green. If it is past due by 1 hour, it turns red. If the event is 2 or more hours in the past the card will be gray.

# Result
* A working planner for the busy individual to keep track of tasks with appropriate due times and color indications.
